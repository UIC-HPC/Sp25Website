# Tales of the Space Age: LEGO Parallel Building Project

**Project Overview**

This project explores the principles of parallel thinking through a hands-on group activity using the **_Tales of the Space Age_** LEGO set. Each team, consisting of a minimum of four members, will devise and execute a parallel building strategy to construct the set.

**Objectives**

- Understand and apply the concepts of parallel thinking.
- Develop a strategy to parallelize the LEGO building process.
- Collaborate effectively within a team.
- Document the strategy and reflect on its efficiency.

**Assignment Instructions**

- The instructor will form a team of at least four members.
- As a team, discuss and document a parallel building strategy.
- Build the "Tales of the Space Age" LEGO set using your strategy and time in the construction process.
- Prepare a report documenting your strategy, the building process, challenges faced, and the total time taken for construction.

**Submission Requirements**

- Each team member is to complete and submit the project form. The form includes:
    - A reflection on the team's experience, including any challenges and how they were addressed.
    - Time taken by each team member.
    - Total time taken for the construction.

**Grading Criteria**

The project is worth **100 points** for both graduate and undergraduate students. Points will be assigned based on completing the project, accuracy of results, and thoughtfulness of the writeup. PDF form is to be uploaded [here](https://forms.office.com/r/5ckp0UCZPy).
